Relational CLIF (RCLIF) is a database that is organized into clinically relevant column categories - demographics, objective measures, respiratory support, orders, and inputs-outputs. Below are sample templates for each table in R-CLIF. Here you can find detailed descriptions of each table and their fields.

You can use our custom GPT- [CLIF Assistant](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-h1nk6d3eR-clif-assistant) to learn more about CLIF and develop analysis scripts.

# CLIF maturity

CLIF is still under development and some parts of the format are more mature than others. CLIF will also need to evolve as the set of minimum Common Data Elements for studying critical illness expands or changes over time.

The consortium has two different maturity concepts: one for the overall ER model and one for the individual tables.

## Overall Maturity Level for CLIF

-   ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maturity-Experimental-red) **Experimental**: Majority of critical illness and hospital course not represented in Entity-Relationship (ER) model, expect frequent breaking changes.
-   ![Beta](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maturity-Beta-yellow) **Beta**: Core ER model complete and breaking changes to the existing structure unlikely. Actively seeking feedback about new tables to add to the ER model to fully capture critical illness.
-   ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maturity-Stable-brightgreen) **Stable**: Tested and recommended for general use. EHR data not currently represented in CLIF outside the scope of the format.
-   ![Mature](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maturity-Mature-blue) **Mature**: Widely adopted across majority of consortium sites with majority of tables in stable or mature (see maturity levels for CLIF Tables). ER model very stable.
-   ![Deprecated](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maturity-Deprecated-lightgrey) **Deprecated**: No longer maintained.

The entity-relationship model for this project is currently at the ![Beta](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maturity-Beta-yellow) **Beta** level for adult patients in a general medical intensive care unit. Major breaking changes to the existing structure are unlikely. The consortium is actively seeking feedback about new tables and fields to add to the ER model to achieve the goal of representing developing a [minimum Common ICU Data Elements (mCIDE)](https://clif-consortium.github.io/website/mcide.html)

For pediatric patients, CLIF is in the ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maturity-Experimental-red) **Experimental** maturity phase. CLIF is also ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maturity-Experimental-red) **Experimental** for adult patients in specialty ICUs (e.g. cardiac intensive care unit, surgical intensive care unit, and neurointensive care unit).

## Maturity Levels for CLIF Tables {#maturity-levels-for-clif-tables}

There are two critical maturity elements for each CLIF table: 1) field structure and 2) Common ICU data Element development. Each CLIF table has one or more consortium physician-data scientists who are responsible for table design.

-   ![Concept](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maturity-Concept-orange) **Concept**: Placeholder for future CLIF table. Majority of table structure and CDE elements incomplete. Expect breaking changes.
-   ![Beta](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maturity-Beta-yellow) **Beta**: Table structure and field names complete, but not fully tested. CDE for category variables underdevelopment. Actively seeking feedback.
-   ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maturity-Stable-brightgreen) **Stable**: Tested and recommended for general use. CDE stable with permissible values for all category variables precisely defined and locked. Fully implemented at multiple consortium sites and used in a peer-reviewed publication.
-   ![Mature](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maturity-Mature-blue) **Mature**: Adopted across a majority of the CLIF consortium sites and very stable.
-   ![Deprecated](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maturity-Deprecated-lightgrey) **Deprecated**: No longer maintained.

The CLIF-1.0 data dictionary is [available here](archive/data-dictionary-1.0.qmd) and is now deprecated

# General inpatient tables

The data in these tables are typically of most electronic data warehouse systems and are not specific to critical illness. The CLIF versions of these general tables are designed to ensure that they clearly represent the minimum set of data required for critical illness research. Whenever possible, CLIF seeks compatibility with existing EHR data standards.

## Patient

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maturity-Beta-yellow)](#maturity-levels-for-clif-tables)

This table contains demographic information about the patient that does not vary between hospitalizations. It is inspired by the OMOP [Person](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54.html#person) table

| language_name | VARCHAR | Patient's preferred language. | Original string from the source data |
| language_category | VARCHAR | Maps `language_name` to a standardized list of spoken languages | Under-development |

## Hospitalization

The hospitalization table contains information about each hospitalization event. Each row in this table represents a unique hospitalization event for a patient. This table is inspired by the [visit_occurance](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54.html#visit_occurrence) OMOP table but is specific to inpatient hospitalizations (including those that begin in the emergency room).

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maturity-Beta-yellow)](#maturity-levels-for-clif-tables)

| Variable Name | Data Type | Definition | Permissible Values |

**Notes**:

1.  If a patient is discharged to Home/Hospice, then `discharge_category == Hospice`.

2.  The geographical indicators(`zipcode_nine_digit`, `zipcode_five_digit`, `census_block_code`, `census_block_group_code`, `census_tract`, `state_code`, `county_code`) should be added if they are available in your source dataset. `zipcode_nine_digit` is preferred over `zipcode_five_digit`, and `census_block_code` is ideal for census based indicators.The choice of geographical indicators may differ depending on the project.

3.  If a patient is transferred between different hospitals within a health system, a new `hospitalization_id` should be created

4.  If a patient is initially seen in an ER in hospital A and then admitted to inpatient status in hospital B, one `hospitalization_id` should be created for data from both stays

5.  A `hospitalization_joined_id` can also be created from a CLIF table from contiguous `hospitalization_ids`

## ADT

The admission, discharge, and transfer (ADT) table is a start-stop longitudinal dataset that contains information about each patient's movement within the hospital. It also has a `hospital_id` field to distinguish between different hospitals within a health system.

# Future proposed tables

These are tables without any defined structure that the consortium has not yet committed to implementing.

-   **Code_status:** longitudinal record containing changes in the patient's code status during the hospitalization over time\
    `hospitalization_id`\
    `start_dttm`\
    `code_status_name`\
    `code_status_category` with levels `c(DNR, UDNR, DNR/DNI, Full, Presume Full, Other)`

-   **Clinical Decision Support**: This table will capture the actions of clinical decision support tools embedded in the EHR. The table will have the following fields: `cds_name`, `cds_category`, `cds_value`, `cds_trigger_ddtm`.
