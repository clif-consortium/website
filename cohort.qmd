The table below showcases the characteristics and outcomes of ICU patient encounters across 11 CLIF consortium sites and MIMIC-IV. The cohort includes all adults (â‰¥ 18 years) admitted to an ICU at each site across the consortium. This represents a diverse cohort of over 850,000 ICU patient encounters and provides valuable insights into critical care practices across different institutions.
